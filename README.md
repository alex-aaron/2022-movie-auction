## 2022 Movie Auction App

This is a single webpage application that runs just on JavaScript, HTML, and CSS (incorporating Bootstrap).

To access this application, navigate to `https://movie-auction.herokuapp.com/` in your browser.

### How to Use the application

This app allows you to keep track of an auction style movie-draft with any number of members.

#### Creating a card for a draft participant

To add a drafter, enter the drafter's name in the form at the top of the page where it says `Enter Name`. Once submitted, a card should appear with the drafter's name, their budget, and a table.

#### Opening a movie to auction

To add a movie to the auction space, enter the film's name into the center form where it says `Enter Movie`. The title of the film should appear in the box below the forms.

#### Keeping track of bids

To keep track of bids, enter the current bids as they come into the right most form where it says `Enter Bid`. This will make the current bid appear in the box below the forms.

#### Completing the bidding process

Once a winning bid has been made, enter the final bid and the drafter's name into the forms beneath the movie box. Once submitted, the movie should be added to the correct drafter's card and their budget should be updated.
